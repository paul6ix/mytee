                        <h3>Advance and Repayment</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. The Lender agrees to advance the Loan and the Obligor agrees to take the Loan subject to
                            the terms and conditions as set out in the Loan application form and also in this offer
                            letter.
                            <br> 2. The Obligor agrees to repay the Loan (principal plus accrued interest) in accordance
                            with the dedicated repayment schedule as provided in the terms and conditions of this offer
                            letter. Such repayment schedule shall be subject to change in line with changes to the
                            Obligor’s salary payment date.
                            <br> 3. The Obligor may terminate the offer letter and repay back all or any part of the
                            borrowed amount on any day before the scheduled maturity date, by paying to the Lender, all
                            interest, fees and other monies then accrued or due under this offer letter to the date of
                            early repayment (whether or not yet payable).
                            <br> 4. The following fees are payable by the Obligor in the event of pre-liquidation as is
                            applicable
                            <br> 5. Where the Obligor makes a payment under the Loan prior to the scheduled repayment
                            date (the “Payment Due Date”), such payment shall be made at least 3 clear business days
                            prior to the Payment Due Date either through Quickteller, PayDirect, bank transfer or cash
                            payment into any designated repayment account provided by the Lender. Evidence of such
                            payment shall be communicated to the Lender, within 24 hours following payment, via email at
                            loan@fynazelimited.com.
                            <br> 6. Where the Obligor fails to make a scheduled repayment at least 3 clear business days
                            prior to the Payment Due Date or makes the scheduled repayment 3 clear business days prior
                            to the Payment Due Date but fails to communicate the early repayment to the Lender within 24
                            hours thereafter, the Lender shall be entitled to present the Obligor’s repayment instrument
                            to 3rd party Banks for processing in line with the relevant applicable clearing guidelines.
                            In such cases, the Obligor will have no recourse against the Lender for presentation of its
                            repayment instrument.
                            <br> 7. Where the Obligor makes a part repayment of the Loan amount in advance, the
                            outstanding repayments will continue from the next Payment Due Date as provided in the
                            Obligor’s dedicated repayment schedule. In addition, the scheduled maturity date of the Loan
                            shall change to the last Payment Due Date of the outstanding repayments following the part
                            repayment.
                            <br> 8. Where the Obligor makes a part repayment of the Loan amount in advance, the Lender
                            may agree to part liquidation of the Obligor’s Loan. This part liquidation shall take effect
                            upon the issuance and execution of a new offer letter by both parties, stating the terms of
                            the part liquidation.
                            <br> 9. Where the Obligor’s primary repayment method for scheduled repayment, part repayment
                            or pre-liquidation is post-dated cheque, the clearance period for said payment is 3 clear
                            business days.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Any communications by the Obligor regarding the loan facility shall be made directly to
                            the Lender via telephone on +2347032948457, via e-mail at loan@fynazelimited.com
                        </p>
                        <h3> Interest</h3>
                        <p>

                            <br> 1. The repayments as calculated in the dedicated repayment schedule, are done on the
                            basis
                            of payment at regular agreed intervals. If the due date for a repayment instalment falls on
                            a non-business day, then the repayment may be paid on the next succeeding business day.
                            Additional interest may accrue in such cases.
                            <br> 2. The Lender will calculate interest at a reducing balance rate on the daily balance
                            outstanding (after adjustment is made for cheques in the course of collection), meaning that
                            interest is charged on the principal outstanding at each month end and the amount of
                            interest paid each month reduces over the term of the Loan. The reducing balance interest
                            rate for this loan is 5%
                            <br> 3. The Lender shall compound interest on the Loan at such interval as it shall
                            determine at
                            its sole discretion.
                            <br> 4. Where the Obligor fails to pay the Lender a repayment instalment by the due date,
                            the
                            Lender will charge default interest at a rate of 1.0% per month/0.033% per day of the
                            overdue amount (outstanding principal + outstanding interest).
                            <br> 5. The Lender will apply default interest rate seven (7) days from the date on which
                            the
                            Obligor was due to pay the sum.
                            <br> 6. The default interest rate:
                            (a) is charged by the Lender in addition to the normal interest rate which it charges the
                            Obligor at the same time and in the same manner as that normal interest.
                            (b) accrues before and after any court judgment, which the Lender obtains against the
                            Obligor.
                            (c) is liquidated damages to compensate the Lender for the additional risk and other
                            administrative costs and expenses associated with the Obligor’s failure to pay the
                            outstanding sum.
                            This offer is subject to a satisfactory credit report and further verification checks. In
                            the event that your application is unsuccessful, your documents shall be returned to you.
                            For the avoidance of doubt, this offer is conditional upon the provision of the satisfactory
                            credit report and further verification checks. The Lender reserves the right to withdraw
                            this offer in the event that the results of the credit and verification checks are
                            unsatisfactory.
                            The Obligor is permitted to rescind this offer within 7 days from the date of execution of
                            this offer letter, provided the Lender has not disbursed the Facility Amount to the Obligor.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Representations and Warranties</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Obligor represents and warrants that:
                            <br> 1. He/she has the right to accept this facility and has taken all necessary actions to

                            any other agreement to which the Obligor is a party.
                            <br> 3. The information given to the Lender verbally, via email or other electronic medium
                            or in
                            other form of writing as well as documents submitted in support of the loan application form
                            is true, accurate and complete. The Obligor is solely responsible for the correctness of
                            such information and the Lender shall have no obligation to verify the authenticity of any

                            If the Obligor suspects that there is an error in the information he or she has provided to
                            the Lender, he or she shall advise the Lender accordingly without delay. The Lender will
                            endeavour to correct the error whenever and wherever possible on a 'best effort' basis but
                            shall have no liability arising there from.
                            <br> 4. He/she shall complete his/her repayment instrument(s) (that is cheque, direct debit
                            mandate or debit card) with true, accurate, up to date and complete personal information and

                            the Obligor is required to inform the Lender of such change.
                            <br> 5. Under no circumstance will the Lender be liable for any loss, expense or damage of
                            any
                            kind incurred by the Obligor due to non-compliance with this requirement.

                            relevant time (before or after the approval and disbursement of the Loan) be a change in the
